The function calctulate discount prices through a loop. Input a list of prices and output the discount prices. Especially when 'var' can be modified.

# 5.
error. because the variable i was defined in the for loop and is therefore not accessible outside of it. 

# 6.
error. because finalPrice is defined in the for loop, code block is in the loop. After the loop finish, it will be destroyed.

# 7.
150
because it's defined in the function rather than in the loop.

# 8.
[50, 100, 150]

# 9.
ReferenceError. because i is declared inside the for loop using let, which means its scope is limited to the loop block. Therefore, i does not exist outside of the loop, and trying to access it will result in an error.

# 10.
3
because length is assigned the value of p.length before the loop.
